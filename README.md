No Close Services is a lightweight Android library designed to keep essential background tasks running reliably, even under aggressive system optimizations such as Doze Mode, App Standby, and OEM-specific battery restrictions. It leverages AlarmManager and periodic server heartbeat pings to reduce the chances of process termination, ensuring your service stays alive when it matters most. Ideal for real-time chat, location tracking, IoT workflows, and any application requiring consistent background execution across devices.
